n = 10,000
Time = 3,088,100 nano seconds

* Question 5.
*We generated an array of distance of points in a unit circle through a given algorithm. All the points generated in the array are from
*(0,1] of double data type to get the highest precision possible. Then, we applied quick sort with the median as the pivot as it offers a
*better complexity than the first element as the pivot which is Î˜(N Log N) from best to worst case scenario. We set the array size between
*1,000 to 100,000,000, and we observed that the time taken by the algorithm to sort the array grows as the function of NLog(N) for sorting
*the double values .

*Sorting uniformly distributed points on a unit circle can have various benefits, such as aiding in computer graphics, image processing,
*and signal processing. Sorting assists in establishing the sequence of points on the circle, which can be crucial in numerous algorithms
*that require the points to be arranged in a specific order. For instance, sorting uniformly distributed points on a unit circle can be
*helpful in drawing curves and other shapes in computer graphics. By connecting the sorted points, we can draw arcs, circles, or other
*geometric shapes with smooth edges.
